# csSFC "Viologue Twilight" User Skin v1<br>
An unofficial Violet/Twilight colourscheme for chipsynth SFC 1.023<br>
<br>
DO NOT CONTACT PLOGUE IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THIS SKIN. They will not support it.<br>
NOTE: Use at your own risk. If chipsynth SFC is ever updated in the future, this skin's update basically depends on if I've updated it to support those new features. :)<br>
<br>
<i><b>How to Install:</b></i><br>
<br>
<b>Step 1</b> - Extract the archive<br><br>
&#8226; Windows<br>
Extract <b>GUI_USER</b> folder and all its contents into the chipsynth SFC root directory. By default it should be <b>C:&#92;Program Files&#92;Plogue&#92;chipsynth SFC&#92;</b><br><br>
&#8226; Mac<br>
Extract <b>GUI_USER</b> folder and all its contents into the chipsynth SFC folder. By default it should be <b>HDD &gt; Library &gt; Application Support &gt; Plogue &gt; chipsynth SFC</b><br>
<br>
<b>Step 2</b> - Change the skin in csSFC<br><br>
Go into the VST's settings, and select the USER skin. This should initialize the skin.<br>
<br>
That's it! Enjoy :)
